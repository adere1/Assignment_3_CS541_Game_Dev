1. Built a simple cross the road game. 
2. Player has left, right, up, down moves. Simple button controller is given for the moves.
3. Up movement is very slow(really hard to cross the road. It's all about timing). left,right and down moves are fast.
4. If player get hit by a car then he come again to the start position.
